Machine Learning (ML) models are used in various applications, affecting societies directly or indirectly in daily life. The Machine learning (ML) field connects computer science and statistics, allowing computers to use collected data or past experience to solve unseen problems. Itâ€™s a must-have skill for every analyst and data scientist. It is also an important skill for anyone who wants to draw conclusions and make scientific suggestions based on collected raw data. A wide range of successful ML applications exist, including systems to predict customer behavior, support decision-making, recognize faces or spoken speech, optimize robot behavior, and extract knowledge from biological data. During this Workshop, participants will learn how to write and train ML models that can help in their field of study. Attendees will have the chance to learn the basics of Python and how to use it to build machine-learning models. In this Workshop, we will use Google Colab as our IDE, but students are free to use their favorite IDE.

## Schedule

The schedule for the workshop is as follows:

```{r}
#| echo: false
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")
readxl::read_xlsx("mlb_schedule_2024.xlsx") |> 
  dplyr::mutate(Topic = ifelse(!is.na(Slides), glue::glue("[{Title}]({Slides})"), Title), .keep = "unused") |> 
  dplyr::mutate(Exercises = ifelse(!is.na(ExURL), glue::glue("[{Exercises}]({ExURL})"), Exercises), .keep = "unused") |> 
  dplyr::mutate(Solution = ifelse(!is.na(SolutionURL), glue::glue("[{Solution}]({SolutionURL})"), Solution), .keep = "unused") |> 
  dplyr::relocate(Topic, Exercises, Solution, .after = Date)
```

## Google Colab
During the workshop, we will use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) as our IDE. We will start by creating a new notebook.

## Checking the Python version and installing different versions 

 and checking the version of Python that is already installed. We run the command:

```
!python --version
```

If we need to install a different version of Python (e.g. 3.7), we can use:

```
!apt-get install python3.7
```

## Installing more Libraries

Most of the important libraries that we may need are already installed in the Google Colab environment. However, if you would like to install additional libraries, you can use the `pip` command. For example, to install `py_stringmatching`, you can use the command:

```
!pip install py_stringmatching
```
::: 

**Note:** when running system commands in Google colab, we use `!` before the command. This is common for running system commands in any notebook environment (you may also use the % symbol `%pip install py_stringmatching`).


::: {.callout-note}
## Running simple Python code

Run the following Python code and explain what the code is doing:

```
t, f = True, False
print(t and f) 
print(t or f)  
print(not t)   
```
